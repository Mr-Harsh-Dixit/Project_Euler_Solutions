# Project Euler Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to problems from **Project Euler**, implemented in multiple programming languages including **Python**, **C++**, and **Java**.

The focus is on:

* **Clear and readable implementations**
* **Efficient algorithms over brute force**
* **Mathematical reasoning and problem-solving techniques**
* **Cross-language comparison of approaches**

This is a learning-driven repository, not a shortcut list.

---

## Languages Used

* Python
* C++
* Java

Each language follows its own idiomatic style while solving the same underlying problem.

```

* Problem numbers are consistent across languages.
* Each file contains a self-contained solution for a single problem.
* Optimized solutions are preferred over naive implementations.

---

## Design Principles

* Avoid unnecessary brute force unless the problem explicitly allows it.
* Use mathematical identities and number theory where applicable.
* Keep code readable before making it clever.
* Prefer time and space efficiency when trade-offs are reasonable.

---

## Notes

* Some problems may have multiple valid approaches; only one is implemented per language unless otherwise stated.
* Explanations are included in comments where the logic is non-trivial.
* This repository is intended for educational purposes.

## Disclaimer

Project Euler problems are owned by Project Euler.
This repository contains **original solution implementations** written for learning and practice.

---

## Progress

Solutions are added incrementally.
Quality and correctness take priority over speed of completion.
